# VAPOR: Versatile Accelerated Physics Optimization Routines

## Description

VAPOR is a lightweight application framework to ease the development of
GPU-accelerated and massively parallel scientific simulation codes. Its
objectives are to:

- Provide lightweight, idiomatic C++ abstractions for high-performance array
  transformations and PDE solvers
- Adapt to hybrid parallel compute architectures (multi-core / multi-node /
  multi-GPU) with near-zero change to the application code
- Enable rapid development of small, targeted, simulation codes, by
  abstracting the business logc of simulation drivers (user configurations,
  checkpointing, real-time post-processing)
- Be header-only and dependency-free; a C++17 compiler is sufficient (optional
  dependencies include CUDA, MPI, and HDF5)
